Open Proteus and create a new project.

On the left side of the window, click on the "P" icon to open the component library. Search for and add the following components to the schematic:

LPC2148 microcontroller
Sensors to read tire speed and slip data (e.g. a rotary encoder for tire speed and a load cell for slip percentage)
A brake system (e.g. a solenoid valve controlled by a transistor)
Connect the components according to the schematic. Use wires to connect the sensors to the appropriate input/output pins on the LPC2148, and use a transistor to control the brake system. Make sure to include any necessary resistors or other components.

Write the ABS code in C and save it to a file. You can use a text editor such as Notepad or a dedicated C development environment such as Keil or IAR.

Use a tool such as Keil or IAR to compile the C code and generate a hex file. This hex file will contain the machine code instructions that the LPC2148 can execute.

In Proteus, select the LPC2148 and go to the "Program Memory" tab in the properties window. Click the "Import Hex" button and select the hex file generated in step 4. This will load the code into the LPC2148's program memory.

Connect power to the circuit by double-clicking on the power supply component and setting the voltage to a suitable value (e.g. 5V).

Run the simulation by clicking the "Start" button in the toolbar. The LPC2148 should execute the ABS code and control the brakes according to the conditions specified in the code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance
