# ABS-USING-LPC2148

*DISCLAIMER: This project was a university-assigned group project done by me and 3 other collogues, their names have been redacted to maintain their anonymity, I do not claim to have done this entire project by myself nor insinuate some ulterior motive by redacting their names.

To design and model a controlling interface that receives information from wheel speed sensors and limits the braking force according to the requirements.

The ABS system was designed to be integrated into a vehicle's existing brake system, using the LPC2148 microcontroller as the central electronic control unit (ECU). Speed sensors were placed on each wheel, and the information was transmitted to the microcontroller for processing. The microcontroller used this information to determine the slip percentage of each tire and decide whether or not to enable the ABS system.

You would need the following tools to run this program:
Proteus
KEIL uVision
